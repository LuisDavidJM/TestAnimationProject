## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS keyframes
- CSS animations

### What I learned

In this project I learned to apply transitions and animations in CSS. For the transitions I learned to give styles to a button, which when hovering over it changed its color and shape.
For animations I learned to use the keyframes that CSS includes by applying them to a div.

### Continued development

As this was a test project, there is no further development that can be done, other than adding more types of animations and transitions that can be used in future projects.
